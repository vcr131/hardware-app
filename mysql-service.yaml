# the service of the db. 
# Considerations to take into account:
# On the local computer, the local MySQL80 service is using port 3306 port. Does this influence the port value we choose in the mysql yaml files? The local MySQL service using port 3306 can potentially conflict with the port configuration in the MySQL YAML files for Kubernetes.
# The python script creates a log file. How do we change the mysql and python yaml files so that we use a Persisten Volume with which the log file is saved on the local computer?

# the service configuration
# search k8 docs for service
# this is the end point of the db. this service needs to forward the request it gets to the serviced pod
